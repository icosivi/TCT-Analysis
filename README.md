# TCT-Analysis
ROOT macros for simple TCT Analysis such as focus finding and 2d-scan of a detector 

During the period of my master thesis in Physics, I worked on the development of an innovative Silicon detector named LGAD, 
Low-Gain Avalanche Detector. A particular kind of detector used for very precise timing, which will be employed, for instance, 
by the CMS experiment at the Large-Hadron Collider in Geneva.

A large part of my work focused on measurements made with an innovative setup developed in Ljubljana by Particulars, the Transient
Current Technique setup (http://www.particulars.si/). The DAQ software provided with such setup heavily relies on macros written
in C++, based on the ROOT framework developed at CERN.

This repository is intended to store the macros I wrote during my work with the TCT, in order to simplify the data analysis for 
anyone who is approaching to TCT and needs simple analysis of taken data.
